# serverbased-program

This is a program which demonstrates client-server communication in Node.js

Node.js provides the ability to perform socket programming. We can create chat application or communicate client and server applications using socket programming in Node.js.

Client- This layer consists of web browsers, mobile browsers or applications which can make HTTP requests to the web server.

Server- This layer has the Web server which can intercept the requests made by the clients and pass them the response.

The Node.js net module contains functions for creating both servers and clients.

In this, I have used two command prompts:

1. Node.js command prompt for server.
2. Default command prompt for client.

The net module of Node.js creates Server is a software application that can
handle the requests sent by Client and return a web page in response to the
Client.
